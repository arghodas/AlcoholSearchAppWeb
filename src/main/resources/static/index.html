                            <p>Beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage worldwide. In fact, after water and tea, beer is the most commonly-
                                consumed drink in the world. Beer is also most likely the oldest alcoholic drink in history. A standard beer,
                                whether it be a lager or an ale, has between 4% to 6% ABV, although some beers have higher or lower
                                concentrations of alcohol. For example, “light beers” only have between 2% to 4% ABV while “malt liquors”
                                have between 6% to 8%.</p>

                                “fortified” with distilled alcohol. Port, Madeira, Marsala, Vermouth, and Sherry are examples of fortified wines.
                                They usually have about 20% ABV.</p>

                            <p>Hard Cider is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of apples, although the legal definition
                                for other fruit ciders can differ from country to country.This is popular in the United Kingdom and the
                                Republic of Ireland and widely available. The UK has the world's highest per capita consumption, as well
                                as its largest cider-producing companies. Ciders from the South West of England, often referred to as ‘Rouge’
                                are generally stronger beverages and considered heritage ciders. Cider is also popular in many
                                Commonwealth countries. In Canada, cider cannot be called cider if there are no apples. Furthermore,
                                according to the Food and Drug Regulations in Canada, cider cannot contain less than 2.5% or over
                                13% absolute alcohol by volume. </p>

                                grains, or hops. The alcoholic content ranges from about 3.5% ABV to more than 20%. The defining characteristic
                                of mead is that the majority of the beverage's fermentable sugar is derived from honey. It may be still,
                                carbonated, or naturally sparkling; dry, semi-sweet, or sweet. </p>

                            <p>Sake is an alcoholic drink brewed from polished rice from Japan . The clear or whitish-cloudy drink contains
                                approx. 15-20 volume percent alcohol .</p>

                            <p>In German, the misleading term rice wine is often used for sake . In terms of production, sake is more similar to
                                a beer , since starch has to be broken down into sugar for alcoholic fermentation. The alcohol content of sake is
                                higher than that of wine made from grapes . In terms of tax law, sake is an intermediate product in Germany , but in
                                Austria it is a fruit wine. Sake makes up about 4% of the alcohol from Japanese, with a downward trend - the largest
                                share beers.</p>
